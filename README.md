# Dentalign

[Screenshot](public/screenshot.png)

Dentalign is a clinic management system that is built with PHP, Tailwind and Bun. It features an MVC architecture similar to that of Laravel. We are not using Laravel to avoid writing Eloquent ORM as we are required to write raw SQL and to learn the architecture ourselves :)

### When cloning, install dependencies first:

```bash
bun install
```

Then run
```bash
bun run dev
```
To start the Tailwind CLI watcher.

Do 
```bash
bun run prettier
```
To format the codebase.

**Use XAMPP to host an Apache Server and an SQL server.**
